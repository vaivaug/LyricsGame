Hey, hey, hey
I got a condo in Manhattan
Baby girl, what's hatnin'?
You and your ass invited
So gon' and get to clappin'
Go pop it for a player, pop-pop it for me
Turn around and drop it for a player, drop-drop it for me
I'll rent a beach house in Miami
Wake up with no jammies (nope)
Lobster tail for dinner
Julio, serve that scampi
You got it if you want it, got, got it if you want it
Said you got it if you want it, take my wallet if you want it, now
Jump in the Cadillac
(Girl, let's put some miles on it)
Anything you want
(Just to put a smile on you)
You deserve it baby, you deserve it all
And I'm gonna give it to you
Cool jewelry shining so bright
Strawberry champagne on ice
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like
Sex by the fire at night
Silk sheets and diamonds all white
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like
I'm talkin' trips to Puerto Rico
Say the word and we go
You can be my fleeka
Girl, I'll be a fleeko, mamacita
I will never make a promise that I can't keep
I promise that your smile ain't gon' never leave
Shopping sprees in Paris
Everything twenty-four karats
Take a look in that mirror (take a look)
Now tell me who's the fairest
Is it you? (is it you?) is it me? (is it me?)
Say it's us (say it's us) and I'll agree, baby
Jump in the Cadillac
(Girl, let's put some miles on it)
Anything you want
(Just to put a smile on you)
You deserve it baby, you deserve it all
And I'm gonna give it to you
Cool jewelry shining so bright
Strawberry champagne on ice
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like
Sex by the fire at night
Silk sheets and diamonds all white
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like
You say you want a good time
Well here I am, baby, here I am, baby
Talk to me, talk to me, talk to me
Talk to me, tell me what's on your mind
What's on your mind
If you want it, girl, come and get it
All this is here for you
Tell me baby, tell me, tell me baby
What you tryna do
Cool jewelry shining so bright
Strawberry champagne on ice
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like (that's what I like)
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like
Sex by the fire at night
Silk sheets and diamonds all white
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like (that's what I like)
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like

That's what I like
Bruno Mars
