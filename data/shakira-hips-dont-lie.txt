Ladies up in here tonight
No fighting
We got the refugees up in here (no fighting)
No fighting
Shakira, Shakira
I never really knew that she could dance like this
She makes a man wants to speak Spanish
Como se llama (si)
Bonita (si)
Mi casa (Shakira Shakira), su casa
Oh baby when you talk like that
You make a woman go mad
So be wise (si) and keep on (si)
Reading the signs of my body (uno, dos, tres, cuatro)
And I'm on tonight you know my hips don't lie
And I'm starting to feel it's right
All the attraction, the tension
Don't you see baby, this is perfection
Hey Girl, I can see your body moving
And it's driving me crazy
And I didn't have the slightest idea
Until I saw you dancing
And when you walk up on the dance floor
Nobody cannot ignore
The way you move your body, girl (just move)
And everything so unexpected, the way you right and left it
So you can keep on shaking it
I never really knew that she could dance like this
She makes a man wants to speak Spanish
Como se llama (si)
Bonita (si)
Mi casa (Shakira Shakira), su casa
Oh baby when you talk like that
You make a woman go mad
So be wise (si) and keep on (si)
Reading the signs of my body (no fighting)
And I'm on tonight you know my hips don't lie (no fighting)
And I am starting to feel you boy
Come on lets go, real slow
Don't you see baby asi es perfecto
I know I am on tonight
My hips don't lie and I am starting to feel it's right
All the attraction, the tension
Don't you see baby, this is perfection (Shakira, Shakira)
Oh boy, I can see your body moving
Half animal, half man
I don't, don't really know what I'm doing
But you seem to have a plan
My will and self restraint
Have come to fail now, fail now
See, I am doing what I can, but I can't so you know
That's a bit too hard to explain
Baila en la calle de noche
Baila en la calle de día
Baila en la calle de noche
Baila en la calle de día
I never really knew that she could dance like this
She makes a man wants to speak Spanish
Como se llama (si)
Bonita (si)
Mi casa (Shakira Shakira), su casa
Oh baby when you talk like that
You know you got me hypnotized
So be wise and keep on
Reading the signs of my body
Señorita,
Feel the conga, let me see you move like you come from Colombia
Mira en Barranquilla se baila así, say it!
En Barranquilla se baila así
Yeah, she's so sexy every man's fantasy a refugee
Like me back with the Fugees from a 3rd world country
I go back like when Pac carried crates
For Humpty Humpty we need a whole club dizzy
Why the CIA wanna watch us? Colombians and Haitians
I ain't guilty, it's a musical transaction
No more do we snatch ropes
Refugees run the seas 'cause we own our own boats (no fighting)
I'm on tonight
My hips don't lie and I am starting to feel you boy
Come on lets go, real slow
Baby like this is perfecto (no fighting)
Oh, you know I am on tonight
My hips don't lie and I am starting to feel it's right
The attraction
The tension
Baby, like this is perfection
No fighting
No fighting
